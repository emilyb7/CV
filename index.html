          <time>Oct 2016 - present</time>
          <p>Learning, teaching and freelancing with <a href="https://foundersandcoders.com" target="_blank"></a>Founders &amp; Coders</p>
          <p>London and Nazareth (Israel)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="experience-description">
          <p>Founders &amp; Coders CIC run a highly competitive, tuition fee-free course in full-stack web development. There are no teaching staff, and graduates of the course are expected to stay on a teach the next group of students.</p>
          <p>I was part of the 9th cohort to go through the course, graduating in early February 2017. Since then I’ve been learning independently, working on a small freelance project for a mental health charity, and mentoring the next generation of Founders &amp; Coders students based in London and Nazareth.</p>

          <p>Product owner at <a href="https://www.campanda.com" target="_blank"></a>Campanda GmbH</p>
          <p>Berlin</p>
        </div>
        <div class="experience-description">
          <p>Campanda is an international e-commerce platform for caravan and campervan rental. I joined the company as a content manager and translator soon after its launch but quickly outgrew the writing and editing of product descriptions, and so persuaded the CEO to let me transition into the product team instead, where I reported directly to the COO.</p>
          <p>Positioned right at the intersection of the business and the technical teams, I oversaw the conception, design, development and launch of several key additions to the core product including on-site customer reviews and a self sign-up page for new rental partners; in 2015 I oversaw the launch of two new localised platforms for the Spanish and Italian markets.</p>
          <p>Most of all, I enjoyed the exposure to tech and working with developers. And so I decided to leave and become one.</p>

        <div class="experience-description">
          <p>Sadly, Roomsurfer was not destined to succeed and the company declared insolvency less than 5 months after I joined. On the plus side, I worked out that I prefer working in product to marketing, and was able to gain useful insight into what a failing startup looks like.</p>
